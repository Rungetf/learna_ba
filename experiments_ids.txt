OPTIMIZATION:
=============

6493747  -> learna first bohb run 30 min max budget on rfam-local-validation  -> failed after 24h to sample new configs, wrong parameter (float) for sequence reward
6493755  -> meta learna first bohb run max 1h budget 1 min validation

6511133  -> restart learna 2 day optimization for sequence reward decision, changed logging to warning, changed float parameter for sequence_reward to integer between 0, 1. should work now



AUTO RL:
========

4 days:

6538964  -> First autoRL bohb-run for LEARNA with num_unsolved objective; 4 days 1000 cores; no sequence output; searches over action-semantics, 3 reward functions, state space (also via reward functions)
6576532  -> AutoRL bohb run meta-LEARNA with num unsolved; 4 days 1000 cores; no sequence output; searches over action-semantics, 3 reward functions, state space (also via reward functions)

PEAK PERFORMANCE VIA JOINT OPTIMIZATION:
========================================

2 days:

6663702  -> Learna optimization 2 days reward=structure only, predict pairs = True, sum of min distances
6663703  -> Meta-learna optimization 2 days; reward = structure_only; predict_pairs=True, sum of min distances

4 days:

6703893  -> LEARNA optimization 4 days reward=structure_only, predict_pairs=1, sum of min distances
6703894  -> Meta-LEARNA optimization 4 days: reward=structure_only, predict_pairs=True, sum of min distances

4 days Meta-LEARNA-Adapt:
6826895  -> 4 day meta-learna-adapt, wait for 10 worker, 5 minutes validation, reward=structure_only, predict_pairs=True, still searching for data + curriculum and individual state composition
