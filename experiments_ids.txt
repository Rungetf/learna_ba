6493747  -> learna first bohb run 30 min max budget on rfam-local-validation  -> failed after 24h to sample new configs, wrong parameter (float) for sequence reward
6493755  -> meta learna first bohb run max 1h budget 1 min validation

6511133  -> restart learna 2 day optimization for sequence reward decision, changed logging to warning, changed float parameter for sequence_reward to integer between 0, 1. should work now

6538964  -> First autoRL bohb-run with num_unsolved objective; 4 days 1000 cores; no sequence output; searches over action-semantics, 3 reward functions, state space (also via reward functions)
